    Happy 13th birthday! 🎉 Salutations from the start of a completely new adventure: your teenage years.<br /> Even though we don't get together very often, I'm so glad we're friends.<br> You're among the kindest, friendliest people I've ever met, which is why I truly admire you.<br> Thirteen is such a special age because it signifies the beginning of new opportunities, goals, and experiences.<br> I hope you cherish every moment of this chapter and create memories that will make you happy for years to come.<br> You deserve to enjoy every happiness life has to offer. 🌸
